- "manifest" -> "playlist"?
- Retaining Input instances for segments without clogging up memory indefinitely

idea: discontinuities with extra decoder config on the packet.
Also, why not just have the packet metadata on the packet? I think that would make things easier overall.
Also: for robustness, do a different track matching algorithm for hls playback. so not use pid but make it simpler like
  if theres only 1 video track then its obvious yknow. Need to see if this is actually needed in the case of ext-x-discontinuity

- EXT-X-MEDIA
- getSegments() API? Any point in partially reading the playlist file? Idk

dont forget ext x media + stream inf both situation
